# Graph-Coloring-problem

Step 1: Input Graph:
Read the input graph, where nodes represent variables and edges represent constraints between variables.

Step 2: Extract Constraints:
Extract constraints from the graph. In graph coloring, the constraint is that no two adjacent nodes can have the same color.

Step 3: Initialize State:
Initialize an empty state where no variable is assigned a value (color).

Step 4: Define CSP Functions:
Validity Check: Define a function to check if the current state satisfies all constraints. In graph coloring, this function ensures that adjacent nodes have different colors.
Constraint Propagation: Implement a constraint propagation algorithm (e.g., AC-3) to enforce constraints and reduce the domain of variables.
Search: Define a search algorithm (e.g., backtracking) to explore the solution space by making variable assignments and backtracking when necessary.

Step 5: Initialize Domains:
For each variable (node), initialize its domain with all possible values (colors).

Step 6: Choose Heuristic:
Select a heuristic function to guide the search process. Heuristics can help in selecting the most promising variable to assign a value to and in selecting the value to assign.

Step 7: Search for Solution:
Start the search process to find a solution. The search algorithm should explore the solution space by making variable assignments and propagating constraints.
If a solution is found, return it. Otherwise, return that no solution exists.

Step 8: Output Solution:

If a solution is found, output the assignment of values (colors) to variables (nodes) that satisfies all constraints.
If no solution is found, output that no solution exists.
